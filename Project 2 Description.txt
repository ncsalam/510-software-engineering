Spreadsheet link
Using the material, expand your use case list from last week by a factor of three
Ask two LLMs to find what is missing in your 1a1 deliverables.
Default focus: ChatGPT and Claude
Other options: Gemini Pro, DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, etc.
⚠️ Note: Some cost $$$, which may limit the number of queries.
Be aware of context window issues (Claude’s is smaller than ChatGPT’s).
For each LLM:
First, offer prompts training them in what is a use case (see below).
Work from a directory containing the relevant docs you downloaded.
Compare results from zero-shot prompting vs careful prompting.
What to hand in:

The new use cases
Reflection document (max half page): differences you see in the LLM reports.
Report the total cost of LLM usage (note: up to $80 is acceptable,
divided 4 ways between 4 team members = $20 each).
Appendix:Prompts to train an LLM about “what is a use case”
Show an LLM example of the use case format (see slide 64 to 75 of these slides). Hints:

Structure the prompt in markdown
Separate sections with e.g.
a use case Divides into predictions, main flow, subflows, alternatives. For example:


Preconditions=”””
The driver approaches the intersection.
The driver checks the status [Check Status].
The driver clears the intersection [Go].”””


Subflows =
