Had dinner here. Got a chicken lollipop, goat dum briyani, mutton haleem,veg dum briyani, crispy fried corn and Gobi 65. All of them tasted good. Briyani had good flavor but the highlight was the goat haleem. It was Ramadan special item they had, it was amazing. Tasty and well prepared. Highly recommend this place.

We certainly coming back here everytime we are craving for Indian food.The last time we came, we ate outside because of ongoing renovation. So today we were able to dine in inside. I love the vibes, music and cleanliness. The food we ordered are goat biryani, lamb biryani and chicken curry. So yummy  . The service was also great. I will recommend this restau to any of my friends who loves Indian cuisine.
