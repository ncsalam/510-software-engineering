Matt H:
A superb dining experience! The attention to detail at this restaurant is incredible, especially for the reasonable price point. Everything from the garnishes to the to-go bag are well thought out. The food is just as delicious as it looks, and brings a lot of elevated twists on classic Indian dishes. The cocktails were also delicous and well-balanced.

Great modern Indian option in the North Raleigh area! The menu features traditional Indian dishes but with a twist - often elevated by drawing inspiration from another global cuisine. The dining experience is upscale, with warm and friendly service. This restaurant is worth a try!

Absolutely amazing food, a perfect blend of flavor profiles with a modern twist on classic Indian dishes. Excellent service and well through our menu and presentation. While I was there, eating and enjoying the food, I couldn't wait to come back with more people and try it again.
